This draft is the first part of a grammar of Japhug (Sino-Tibetan/Trans-Himalayan, China, Sichuan, Mbarkham county). It focuses on the dialect of Kamnyu village (\forme{kɤmɲɯ}, in Chinese \zh{干木鸟村}, coordinates: 32.2068034,101.9481512).

The examples are mainly based on a text corpus partially available on the Pangloss Archive (\url{http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list\_rsc.php?lg=Japhug}, though additional examples from casual conversations and elicitations are also included.

The glosses follow the Leipzig glossing rules. Other abbreviations in this work include: \textsc{auto}  autobenefactive-spontaneous, \textsc{anticaus} anticausative, \textsc{antipass} antipassive, \textsc{appl} applicative, \textsc{emph} emphatic, \textsc{fact} factual, \textsc{genr} generic, \textsc{ifr} inferential, \textsc{indef} indefinite, \textsc{inv} inverse,  \textsc{lnk} linker, p.n. personal name, pl.n. place name, \textsc{poss} possessor, \textsc{ego.prs} egophoric present, \textsc{prog} progressive, \textsc{sens} sensory.
