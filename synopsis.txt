
Synopsis
Japhug is a vulnerable Gyalrongic language belonging to the Trans-Himalayan (Sino-Tibetan) family, spoken by several thousand speakers in Mbarkham county, Rngaba district, Sichuan province, China. This grammar is the result of nearly 20 years of fieldwork on one variety of Japhug, based on a corpus of narratives and conversations, which is partially available in the Pangloss collection. It covers the whole grammar of the language, and the text examples provide a unique insight into Gyalrong culture.
It is presented for a general linguistics audience, and should be useful for specialists of Trans-Himalayan historical linguistics, typologists, as well as anthropologists studying Gyalrong areas. It is also hoped that some readers will use it to learn Japhug and pursue research on this fascinating language in the future.

Guillaume Jacques, Centre national de la recherche scientifique

Guillaume Jacques has been doing fieldwork on Japhug since 2002. He is currently directeur de recherche (senior researcher) at CNRS (CRLAO), and is also affiliated with INALCO and EHESS. In addition to Japhug, he has also done research on several Gyalrongic languages (Zbu, Situ, Stau), and other languages of the Trans-Himalayan family, in particular Khaling (Kiranti). Several of his PhD students have written grammars of Gyalrongic languages, including Lai Yunfan (Khroskyabs), Gong Xun (Zbu) and Zhang Shuya (Situ). His interests include language documentation, typology (in particular voice and indexation), panchronic linguistics, neogrammarian historical linguistics, language phylogeny and ethnolinguistics.
